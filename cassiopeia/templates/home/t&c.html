      <p>Last Update: Jul 20, 2018</p>
      <h2 class="h2">Introduction</h2>
      
      <p>Thank you for using Cassiopeia ("i"). These are the terms of use (“Terms”), which apply to your use of the Cassiopeia website (“Site”) and the services available to you on the Site (“Services”). If you do not agree to these Terms, you must discontinue using the Site and terminate your registration with us. The Site is owned by Cassiopeia, Inc.
      
      <h2 class="h2">Registration</h2>
      
      <p>When you register with Cassiopeia, you will be asked to provide us with personally identifiable information that we may request, all of which will become part of your profile and which you can add to or change from time to time. You will also be asked to select a screen name and password which will serve to identify you as a registered user each time you visit the Site and allow you to access your account. You may not (i) select or use a screen name of another person with intent to impersonate that person, (ii) use a screen name in which another person has rights without authorization from that person, or (iii) use a screen name that Cassiopeia, at its sole discretion, deems offensive. You agree to provide (i) true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself as prompted by the registration form, and (ii) maintain and properly update your profile to keep it true, accurate, current and complete. If you provide information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or Cassiopeia has reasonable grounds to suspect that you have, we have the right to suspend or terminate your registration status and deny you future use of the Site and the Services (or any portion thereof).</p>
      <p>You must be at least 14 years old to register and use the Services independently as a minor. You may use Cassiopeia if you are under 14 provided you are doing so under the guidance of your school, parent or guardian.</p>

      <h2 class="h2">Use of the Site</h2>
      <p>This Site and the Services offered are intended for your personal, noncommercial use in accordance with these terms. Your account is for use by a single individual only and may not be shared. You agree that you will not (i) copy, display or distribute any part of the Site, in any medium, for any commercial purposes, or (ii) alter or modify any part of the Site other than as may be reasonably necessary to use the Site for its intended purpose. You further agree that you will not use any automated devices, such as spiders, robots or data mining techniques to catalog, download, store or otherwise reproduce, store or distribute content available on the Site, or to manipulate the Site or the Services, or otherwise exceed the limited access granted to you by Cassiopeia.</p>

      <h2 class="h2">Personal Profile</h2> 
      <p>By creating a profile and accessing content on the Site that information and your activity on the Site is visible to everyone who visits the Site, registered users and visitors alike, unless you choose to make it invisible. You can enable or disable the invisible mode at any time. However, enabling invisible mode will not affect information that had been previously posted. Any previously posted information may still be visible to other users. Cassiopeia makes every effort to ensure that your profile and posts are displayed based on your privacy preference. However, mistakes can happen. If you believe that your profile or activities are being displayed in a manner that you did not authorize, you can notify us of the error by using the “Contact Us” button on any page of the Site and we will correct the problem promptly. However, you agree that your sole remedy against us if we were to make such a mistake is to require us to change the privacy settings to those that you originally requested.</p>
